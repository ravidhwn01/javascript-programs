 1.  What do you understand about cookies?
 ans: A cookie is generally a small data that is sent from a website and stored on the user’s machine by a web browser that
 was used to access the website. Cookies are used to remember information for later use and also to record the browsing activity on a website.
 
 2.  How would you create a cookie?

The simplest way of creating a cookie using JavaScript is as below:
document.cookie = "key1 = value1; key2 = value2; expires = date";

3.  How would you read a cookie?

Reading a cookie using JavaScript is also very simple. We can use the document.cookie string that contains the cookies that we just created using that string.

The document.cookie string keeps a list of name-value pairs separated by semicolons, where ‘name’ is the name of the cookie, and ‘value’ is its value. We can 
also use the split() method to break the cookie value into keys and values.

4.  How would you delete a cookie?
To delete a cookie, we can just set an expiration date and time. Specifying the correct path of the cookie that we want to delete is a good practice since some
browsers won’t allow the deletion of cookies unless there is a clear path that tells which cookie to delete from the user’s machine.

function delete_cookie(name) {

  document.cookie = name + "=; Path=/; Expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:01 GMT;";

}
